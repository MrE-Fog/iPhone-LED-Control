# iPhone-LED-Control
This project is relatively simple. Using two devices (iPhone and a Raspberry Pi 2), I control the state of an LED on a bread board.

# Raspberry Pi 2 B+
The Raspberry Pi 2 is running Node.js on top of Raspbian. By importing a couple software packages I was able to manipulate the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and control the LED.
